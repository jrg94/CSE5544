# Assignment 03

[Assignment 03][2] is a two part assignment based on event analysis.

## Part One (1-5)

During part one, we were asked to come up with some visualization methods
for the EHR data set. 

### Group (1)

Jeremy Grifski

### Tasks & Visualization (2, 3, 5)

Data of interest:

- PatientID
- Flags (PTSD, Depression, Audiology, etc.)

Tasks:

- Count flag total per patient over time
  - Line plot (flag count over time)
- Count lifetime flags per patient against total incidents (# of occurrences of PatientID)
  - Scatterplot (lifetime flag totals vs. incident count)
- Interactive
  - Both plots show an overview of everything
  - Allow for patient selection which fades out both graphs
  
Inspiration:

![Controlling the Blue Line][1]

Design:

### Design Analysis (4)

- how does the design address *event-relevant* tasks?
- how many items can the design show on a 24-inch monitor?
- does it use overview+detail technique?
- does it show "temporal" changes?
- whether or not it introduces clutter by comparing with all other designs
- is the design visually pleasing?

## Part Two (6)
