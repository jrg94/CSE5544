# Interactive Analysis of Word Vector Embeddings: Paper Summary

At a high level, this paper discusses various tasks related to word vector 
embeddings, defines a set of key tasks, demonstrates a set of of visualizations 
to address those tasks, and, finally, shares user feedback. 

In terms of background, the authors do a great job of explaining what word 
vector embeddings are and how they're modeled. In particular, they explain 
how word vector embeddings represent the semantic relationship between words. 
Those relationships can then be demonstrated using a variety of visualization 
techniques. To further prove this, the authors build their own visualizations.

Since I had no prior background in the subject, I found the content to be 
rather technical. However, I find the reading beneficial for two reasons. 
For one, it gives a nice overview of several visualization techniques which 
can be used in other application areas. In addition, it demonstrates the 
power of tools like Python and D3 for data analysis and visualization.
