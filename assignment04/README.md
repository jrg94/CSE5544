# Assignment 04

In assignment 4, we were asked to directly visualize a 2D vector field from
a given data file. Naturally, [I used D3][1]. In the following sections, I'll
explain my findings.

## Direct visualization

To visualize the vector field, I used several data filtering methods. For the
sake of completeness, I'll share all of the figures I generated below.

### Figure 1

The following visualization demonstrates 1 x 1 sampling.
