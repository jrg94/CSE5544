# CSE 5544 Assignment 02

In this assignment, we were asked to review two visualizations: one effective
and one ineffective. These visualizations must come from a written publication,
so we can follow their design process. Examples papers can be found on the
course [paper list][1].

## Background

As a bit of background, I chose to read up on some of the music research as
it's related to my final project and personal research interests. The following
list of papers have been aggregated for my personal use:

- [Analyzing Visual Mappings of Traditional and Alternative Music Notation][2]
- [An approach to leveraging multitrack information for artistic music visualization][3]
- [VISUALIZING MUSIC IN ITS ENTIRETY USING ACOUSTIC FEATURES: MUSIC FLOWGRAM][4]
- [SIMPLE: ASSESSING MUSIC SIMILARITY USING SUBSEQUENCES JOINS][5]
- [IMPROVING VISUALIZATION OF HIGH-DIMENSIONAL MUSIC SIMILARITY SPACES][6]
