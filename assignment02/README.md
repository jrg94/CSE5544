# CSE 5544 Assignment 02

In this assignment, we were asked to review two visualizations: one effective
and one ineffective. These visualizations must come from a written publication,
so we can follow their design process. Examples papers can be found on the
course [paper list][1].

Each visualization must be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- How effective do you judge this visualization to be? Why?
- What are the most noticeable elements of the visualization? Are they the most important?
- Is there essential information missing?
- Are there elements which carry no information?
- Are colors used effectively?
- Does this visualization encourage any misperceptions?
- How could this visualization be improved? Offer specific suggestions.

In total, each review should be between a half and a full page of prose.

## Background

As a bit of background, I chose to read up on some of the music research as
it's related to my final project and personal research interests. The following
list of papers have been aggregated for my personal use:

- [Analyzing Visual Mappings of Traditional and Alternative Music Notation][2]
- [An approach to leveraging multitrack information for artistic music visualization][3]
- [VISUALIZING MUSIC IN ITS ENTIRETY USING ACOUSTIC FEATURES: MUSIC FLOWGRAM][4]
- [SIMPLE: ASSESSING MUSIC SIMILARITY USING SUBSEQUENCES JOINS][5]
- [IMPROVING VISUALIZATION OF HIGH-DIMENSIONAL MUSIC SIMILARITY SPACES][6]

For this particular assignment, I chose to evaluate visualizations from the first
and third papers.

## The Effective Visualization

After reviewing a few papers, I decided that the most effective visualization was from
the following paper:

**Miller, Matthias, et al. "Analyzing Visual Mappings of Traditional and Alternative 
Music Notation." arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.10814 (2018).**

In particular, I took interest in the application of the music flowgram detailed
in the paper:
