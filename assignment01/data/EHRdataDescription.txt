I spent sometime this weekend retrieving, standardizing, and organizing
data that can be used for our projects.  Attached is a sample dataset with
5,673 clinical encounters generated by 45 mTBI patients.  The goal is the
pull data for around 1,000 patients.

Each row corresponds to individual clinical encounters.  Each row have:

1) Demographics information (PatientID, Gender, Age, Age_Group)

2) Injury Information (Age_TBI  [age when their 1st TBI occurred],
Days_From1stTBI [negative means days before, positive days after], Date of
Injury, Type of Injury Code [NSFINJ = actual day of the injury, VCODE =
sometime after the actual injury])

3)Encounter Information (EncounterID, Encounter_date, Encounter_Source
[don't worry about this for now], Provider_Specialty, Provider_type,
Product_Line)

4) Other flags (TBI_encounter_flag,  WarRelated_flag, PRE_max_days (to know
how much data we have pre), POST_max_days (to know how much data we have
Post injury)

5) Diagnosis flags [0=no, 1=yes] (Stress, PTSD, Speech, Anxiety, Depression,
Headache, Sleep, Audiology, Vision, Neurologic, Alzheimer, Cognitive, PCS,
Endocrine, Skull_inj, NON_skull_inj)  Note that many encounters will have
all the diagnosis flags as zeros.  In those cases we know that that specific
encounters wasn't a TBI-related encounter... they went to the doctor for
something completely different such as the flu, surgery, fever, rash, annual
check-up, etc...

If you have any questions, please let me know.  I'll be happy to talk today
to better explain the dataset.

Sincerely,
