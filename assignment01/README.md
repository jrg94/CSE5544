## Features

In this section, I'll be covering the two best and one worst feature of
the two tools I used: VTK and D3.

### VTK

By far, the **worst** feature of VTK is installation. As a PC user, I had to go
through an incredibly lengthy installation process just to start rendering
visualizations.

According to the official documentation, installing VTK is a 7-step process:

1. Download VTK
2. Download CMake
3. Create a Build Folder
4. Run CMake
5. Open the Visual Studio Project
6. Install the Project
7. Manual Building

In total, I spent about a day and a half getting all this together. After all,
the CMake build and the Visual Studio build both take about a half an hour. And,
if you're like me, you don't have Visual Studio or CMake, so downloading and
installing those tools takes some time. In addition, the directions include some
implicit instructions on how to run CMake and Visual Studio, so I had to spend
some time learning the ropes there as well.
